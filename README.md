# VR_RPG
A single-player fantasy RPG game in virtual reality (VR). Using Unreal Engine 4, our team is passionate about creating this unique experience. The end goal is to take role playing to the next level by allowing the player to enter the virtual world and feel as though the game is real. This project was initiated in May 2020 and is continuing development to this day.
